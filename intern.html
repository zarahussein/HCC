                <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <p> I am Zara Hussein, an IT student at the African leadership University in Mauritius.
                    I am the daughter of an Ethiopian mother and Somali father, but I grew up in Somaliland (north
                    Somalia,which separated from Somalia in 1991 but is unrecognized internationally).
                    I am introverted, left-handed, and according to sixteen personality types of the Myers-Briggs,
                    I am an INTP person. I am a poet, and filmmaker, and I am one of the authors of Anthology eBook call
                    poetry against terror and later on, participated in many anthology Poetry.
                    This year I am interning with Hargeisa Cultural Center which locates Hargeisa Somaliland.

                <h2> Placement Journey </h2>
                <p> Last year, I interned with Hargeisa Cultural Center, and after a few months, I decided to apply for
                    the internship with center again because last time I interned with the Center, I gained practical
                    and network connection with people from different background. I did meet filmmakers, Tv hosts,
                    politicians,and friends from all around the world. I sent an email to the Manager and asked if I can
                    intern with the Center again. Fortunately, I was allowed to intern with the center again.</p> <br>

                <h2> The Work undertaken </h2>
                <p> This year's Book Fair event will happen on 21-27 July. As an intern, I am working with the
                    department of the administration, and my role is to send invitations to guess speakers and send
                    email to approved participants of the event. I am also working on the database. I am updating
                    library books because each year, the authors who participate event of Bookfair gives the library
                    copy of their new books as well as I am registering the number of the books that will be selling
                    during the event. This is just a work I am appointed by i do help if any dipartment need help. </p>
